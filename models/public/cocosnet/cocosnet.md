## Use Case and High-Level Description

Cross-domain correspondence network is a exemplar-based image translation model. For details see [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.05571).

## Example

## Specification for Correspondence model

| Metric            | Value                |
|-------------------|----------------------|
| Type              | Image Translation    |
| GFLOPs            | ?                    |
| MParams           | ?                    |
| Source framework  | PyTorch\*            |

## Specification for Generative model

| Metric            | Value                |
|-------------------|----------------------|
| Type              | Image Translation    |
| GFLOPs            | ?                    |
| MParams           | ?                    |
| Source framework  | PyTorch\*            |

## Accuracy of composite (CoCosNet) model

| Metric | Original model | Converted model |
| ------ | -------------- | --------------- |
| PSNR   | 12.98dB        | 7.76dB          |
| SSIM   | 0.238          | 0.3             |
